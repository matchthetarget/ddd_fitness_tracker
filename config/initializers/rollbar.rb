  # Additionally, you may specify the following:
  # config.person_username_method = "username"

  # 'ignore' will cause the exception to not be reported at all.

  # If you run your staging application instance in production environment then
  # you'll want to override the environment reported by `Rails.env` with an

  # Filter non-actionable client errors out of the exception tracker.
  #
  # Bots constantly probe for paths that don't exist (POST /, OPTIONS /,
  # GET /app/etc/local.xml, HEAD /backup, path-traversal strings, malformed
  # multipart bodies, etc.). Rails handles all of these correctly — it returns
  # a 4xx — so they are not application bugs. At bot volume they generate
  # thousands of events that exhaust the error-tracking quota and bury real
  # errors. Drop them at the source.
  #
  # Tradeoff: this also silences a genuinely broken *internal* link (a typo'd
  # `link_to` that now 404s). That's acceptable — those surface in dev/test and
  # in user reports, and it's far cheaper than thousands of bot 404s.
  #
  # Note: we deliberately do NOT ignore ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound or
  # AbstractController::ActionNotFound — those can signal real bugs and stay
  # reportable.
  #
  # Rollbar matches these keys against `exception.class.name` exactly — there is
  # no walk up the ancestor chain (rollbar 3.x, notifier.rb#filtered_level) —
  # so each concrete class a bot can trigger must be listed by name.

    # like "../../../etc/services", SQLi strings), which Rails rejects with a
    # 406 before routing.

    # Malformed multipart bodies, bad parameter encoding, and invalid
    # query/path params. Rails wraps the underlying Rack/encoding error and
    # re-raises it under this single class, so the one key covers all three
    # ("Invalid request/query/path parameters: ...").
    "ActionController::BadRequest" => "ignore",
    # Malformed JSON (or other) request bodies. Unlike the encoding/query cases
    # above, this is NOT wrapped into ActionController::BadRequest, so it needs
    # its own key.
